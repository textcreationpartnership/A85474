            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>It continues in Heaven, because he is there; it continues on Earth, because he is on our Altars: So that having once Died for us on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> he still offers himself, as having been Immolated for us on that holy Mount. But whether then on Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> or now in Heaven, or on our Altars, the Victim, and the Oblation of the Victim, are every where the same; it being no other than Jesus Christ, who is both the Oblation and the Offerer in Quality of Priest Eternal; as was foretold in the Psalms: <hi>Thou art a Priest for Ever according to the Order of Melchisedech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Oblation then being not only a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial; but likewise a continued Application of the Merits of Christ's Passion to us, we have great reason to bless our Redeemer for having made choice of our Altars, there daily to offer himself to the Eternal Father, and perpetuate the Oblation he made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on the Cross; and by this holy Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his Love to excite us daily, not only with gratitude to Commemorate his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but likewise powerfully move us to use all possible Endeavors for becoming Faithful Servants to so good a Master, having there provided us the most effectual Means, for obtaining of the Father, all those Helps and Graces necessary to so great a Work. In this
<pb facs="tcp:154165:3"/> consists the Substance of our Public Liturgy, where Christ is the invisible Offerer, and the Priest performs the Ministry, to which he is called. <hi>Ministrorum vice sumus,</hi> says St. <hi>Chrisostom; qui vero haec sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat &amp; transmutat, ipse est</hi> (Christus.) We hold the place of Ministers; but he that sanctifies these Gifts, and changes them, is Christ himself: He that wrought those things at the last Supper, does what is done here. This great Oblation then, thus made by Christ and his Ministers, is the subject of our daily Worship; to this the Faithful are daily called, as having their part too in this Offering; both in presenting it to Almighty God, and by Means of it hoping for Blessings from the Divine Bounty: In what manner they are to assist at it, is the business of these short Instructions, in which tho' there be nothing new, yet the Method may still be helpful to all Conditions; to the Ignorant, in giving them some light into this great Mystery; and to the well Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by leading them still farther into this Abyss of Power and Goodness, in which the most advanc'd have still farther to go.</p>
            <p>But while I speak of this Oblation, I am very sensible of its being a Consequence of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and that there can be no Devotion expected here,
<pb facs="tcp:154165:4"/> but what is built on this Doctrine; and therefore, for the laying a Foundation to this little Work, I think it very reasonable, by way of Preamble, to clear some Difficulties belonging to this Point; not that I pretend to explain the manner how Christ is present in this Mystery, but in a matter, where Reason is at a stand, to make this wonder credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at least, by laying before her other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works of the Almighty; that one incomprehensible may prepare the way for another. 'Tis the Method St. <hi>Gregory</hi> us'd in explicating the Mystery of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Apparitions. <hi>Hom.</hi> 26. <hi>in Evang.</hi> The Works of God, says he, would not be the subject of our wonder, if they could be comprehended by our Reason; nor has that Faith any Merit, where it has Experience to demonstrate it. These works then of our Redeemer, which of themselves are above our Reason, must be consider'd by other Works of his; that so what is wonderful, may gain Credit from other things yet more wonderful. In this manner I shall, without offence, touch at some Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties relating to this Doctrine, and see how far the Works of God will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Truth of this Mystery to our Belief.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> Then, By what Power is it to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd,
<pb facs="tcp:154165:4"/> that what was Bread and Wine, can be chang'd into the Body and Blood of Christ?</p>
            <p>By the Divine Power, of which we have so many Instances in H. Scripture. That Power by which the Waters were turn'd into Blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 20. The Dust into Lice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife into a Pillar of Salt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 26. The Water into Wine, at the Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee, Jo.</hi> 2. 9. That Power which the Devil own'd in Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 3. when he said to him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that these Stones be made Bread.</hi> That Power may be easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd sufficient to change the Bread and Wine into Christ's Body and Blood. 'Tis the Power of God, whom in our Creed we believe <hi>Almighty;</hi> He who made all things of nothing, can, whenever he pleases, change one thing into another. He spoke in the Creation, and all things were made; he speaks afterward, and by his Word things are chang'd; because he has Power to make things be, what he says they are. As therefore Christ saying to the Noble Man, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 50. whose Son was sick at <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Go thy way; thy Son liveth;</hi> by his Power made him to be, as he said he was. So here Christ saying, <hi>This is my</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154165:5"/>
               <hi>Body; This is my Blood;</hi> his Power and Truth make it to be, what by his Word, he says it is. Christ says it, and because we can neither question his Power nor Truth, we therefore believe it to be what he so solemnly asserts it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> How can the Body of Christ be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd whole and entire under the compass of a piece of Bread or Wafer?</p>
            <p>We don't apprehend Christ's Body to be in the Sacrament, after that <hi>Gross, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Corporeal manner,</hi> as some of the Disciples seem'd to understand it, when they cried out, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 60. <hi>This is a hard saying, who can hear it?</hi> But after a more <hi>Perfect</hi> and even <hi>Spiritual manner</hi> of being. To conceive this aright, you must observe out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43. There are two very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Being proper to a Human Body, according to its different States. For it may be either Corruptible or Incorruptible; Mortal or Immortal; Natural or Spiritual. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> discoursing of the manner, in which our Bodies shall be at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, says, <hi>v.</hi> 53. that then <hi>This Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible must put on Incorruption, and this Mortal must put on Immortality.</hi> And, <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>It is sown a Natural Body,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154165:5"/>
               <hi>it is raised a Spiritual Body. There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Body.</hi> Now, tho' it be not possible to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin how a Human Body, when it is in its <hi>Corruptible, Mortal</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> manner of Being that is so extended and gross, as here it is, can be truly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contain'd under the Form of a Wafer: Yet when this same Body has put on its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Perfect manner of Being, and is now become <hi>Incorruptible, Immortal, and even Spiritual,</hi> there is not then that difficulty of apprehending it: Because being now become in its qualities like a Spitit; and a Spirit requiring no extension or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of place for its Being; so neither does a <hi>Body,</hi> when it is become <hi>Spiritual.</hi> As therefore, you can easily conceive, how a Spirit may be really under the Compass of a Wafer, so likewise may it be understood of Christ's Body, which is not imagin'd to be there in its Corporeal and Natural manner of Being; but as it is Incorruptible, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and a Spiritual Body.</p>
            <p>By keeping close to this Thought, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other difficulties may be solv'd, relating to this subject. For Christ's Body being in the Sacrament, according to this Perfect manner of Being, even like a Spirit it may be apprehended, how the Sacrament may be
<pb facs="tcp:154165:6"/> Broken, without Injuring or Breaking his Body: As when a Man's Body is Broken, or a Limb cut off, the Soul remains still Entire, because it is a Spirit, and not subject to such Accidents as these. Thus likewise may it be conceiv'd, how the Body of Christ may be whole and entire in every part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the Sacred Host is divided; as also, how it may be in many places at once: For tho' we cannot easily understand this possible to an extended Body, and in its Corporeal manner of Being; there's no such difficulty in Relation to a Spirit, or other thing in its manner of being like a Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Spirit has no dependance on place, nor is confin'd either to it, or by it?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> How then is it the same Body of Christ, which was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Crucified, since it is so very different from it?</p>
            <p>Tis the same true and real Body of Christ, which was Born and Crucified, the same, I say, in substance, but different, as to its <hi>manner of being:</hi> As the very same Bodies, in which we now live, shall rise again, the same in substance, but very different in their manner of being, as being then to be Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and become Immortal and Spiritual: Ʋpon which Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>English</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154165:6"/> Bible Printed at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1629. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, that however this supposes a change in the Bodies, yet 'tis <hi>not changing the Substance;</hi> which Explication being allow'd in our Case, it clears this difficulty: And there's reason enough to admit it, if it be consider'd, how Christ enter'd in amongst his Disciples, the Doors being shut; that he was Born without injury to his Mother's Virginal Integrity; that he passed thro' the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, more than once, without being seen or perceiv'd: In which Instances, there are grounds to believe, Christ assumed this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural and Spiritual Manner of Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not only after his Resurrection, when his Body was Glorified, but likewise before.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> How can this be Reconcil'd with the Sences: For our Seeing and Tasting tell us, the Eucharist is Bread and Wine after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration; and must not we believe them, since God has given us these very Powers for this end?</p>
            <p>This must be Answer'd by asking another Question. What did <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> see at the Sepulcher? <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 5. The Scripture says, She <hi>saw a Young Man sitting at the Right side Cloath'd in a long White Robe:</hi> And no question, her <hi>Eyes</hi> told her, it was a Young Man from what she saw, and her <hi>Ears</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154165:7"/> from what she heard him speak. And, after all this Information of her Sences, was it a Young Man? No; for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd, it was an Angel: And the <hi>English</hi> Bible now mention'd, in the Margin on <hi>Mark</hi> 16. says, <hi>It was the Angel of God in the likeness of a Young Man.</hi> Now, how is this to be Reconcil'd with the Sences? The same difficulty may be made in the <hi>Dove,</hi> seen over Christ at his Baptism, and the <hi>Fiery Tongues,</hi> over the Apostles at <hi>Pentecost.</hi> For tho' the Information of <hi>Sence,</hi> in these Cases, was, that they were <hi>Young Men,</hi> a <hi>Dove,</hi> and <hi>Fiery Tongues,</hi> yet you see, our <hi>Faith</hi> goes otherwise, and we believe, they were not, in Substance, what they appear'd to be, but an <hi>Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> under those Forms. And if it be examin'd, why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there was really an Angel, and the Holy Ghost, and not a Young Man, a Dove, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the reason is, because God has reveal'd it in Holy Writ; and expresly assur'd us, what they were; and therefore, upon his Word, we make no difficulty of believing it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the information of <hi>Sence</hi> to the contrary. Thus we do in our Case: Our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tell us, as yours do, that the Sacrament appears to be nothing, but Bread and Wine; and yet we believe, there is really present in it Christ's Body and Blood, because God has
<pb facs="tcp:154165:7"/> reveal'd it in Holy Writ, and expresly said, <hi>It is his Body that was given for us, and his Blood that was shed for us.</hi> And are we to be Censur'd for believing, what he so solemnly tells us? Some indeed are here greatly concern'd for the <hi>Sences,</hi> and seem troubled for our questioning their Authority, and not acknowledging their Infallibility; when, in reality, we do no more here than others, without the least difficulty, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances above-mentioned. We have as great a deference for the <hi>Sences,</hi> as others, and confess their Authority; but, 'tis true, we have a much greater for <hi>God's Sacred Word, and the truth of what he says:</hi> And therefore, whenever these seem to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, and we have one sort of Information from the <hi>Sences,</hi> and another from <hi>God's Word,</hi> we confess our resolution of preferring <hi>God's Word,</hi> before the <hi>Sences,</hi> and own our selves bound to maintain his <hi>Authority and Infallibility</hi> rather than theirs; so that if one must give way, it is evident, which it is to be; and likewise, on whom our Faith is to depend, that is, on God, rather than Man; on what God says, rather than on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Information of Sence. And this is the Rule followed above, tho' here reproved by some.</p>
            <p>But now, to Reconcile this whole Matter,
<pb facs="tcp:154165:8"/> I think 'tis plain, the Sences are not here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at all: For the <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Tongue</hi> say, in regard of the B. Eucharist; it has the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi> of Bread and Wine; and this is certainly true, for it has so; here's no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in this: But now, when the <hi>Judgment,</hi> from this report made by these Two Sences, presently and peremptorily pronounces, <hi>It is Bread and Wine,</hi> here is the mistake, in this over-hasty proceeding of the Judgment, which, to pronounce aright in many Cases, is under a necessity of examining and consulting the <hi>Hearing,</hi> and taking advice with this Sence too: And without this, it is most certainly expos'd to many gross mistakes, and must be Censur'd as very rash and precipitate.</p>
            <p>This we see it is bound to, in regard of many things, which are natural, especially such as are not very obvious and common, as in <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Metals;</hi> for how many of this kind do we daily meet with, which, when we have examin'd with our <hi>Eyes,</hi> with our <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>Feeling,</hi> we yet know not what they are, and cannot frame a certain and true Judgment of them, till by our <hi>Hearing,</hi> we are inform'd from some more Experienc'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what they really are? Here our <hi>Eyes</hi> may tell us indeed, what the <hi>Colour</hi> is, and the <hi>Tongue</hi> what <hi>Taste;</hi> but if the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should hence pretend to declare with
<pb facs="tcp:154165:8"/> assurance, <hi>What the things are;</hi> how easily might it run into mistakes; not because these <hi>Sences</hi> are deceiv'd; but because it takes not its information from the Sence, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this case to give it; because it attends to the report of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> which is insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, when it should have regard to the Ears? And now if we turn to such things, in which Art is concern'd, which makes an <hi>alteration beyond Nature,</hi> such are the Compounds of the Apothecary, the Chymist, the Perfumer, of almost all Trades in their kind, nay, even of Cooks too; all these know how to mix and disguise things with that Art, and give them many Qualities of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Taste</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi> which belong not to them, that they are kinds of <hi>Mysteries;</hi> and to judge by the <hi>Eyes,</hi> by the <hi>Tongue,</hi> by the <hi>Touch,</hi> or the <hi>Smell,</hi> would be many times to go out of the way; and there's no surer means of avoiding <hi>Mistakes,</hi> than to hear from the <hi>Artist,</hi> and from this <hi>Sence</hi> conclude what they are; and this is not to contradict or lay aside the Sences, but only to consider, which of them is most proper, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Case, to inform the Judgment, and follow that.</p>
            <p>And is it not thus too, in all those Cases, where God is pleas'd to intervene with his <hi>Extraordinary and Miraculous Power?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:154165:9"/> We know he can change, whenever he pleases, the Nature of things beyond all Human Arts; and make <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Infinite</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings appear under <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Corporeal</hi> Forms: And now, tho' in <hi>ordinary</hi> Cases our <hi>Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. give sufficient direction to our Judgment; yet in such as are the subject of an <hi>extraordinary Power,</hi> 'tis impossible they should give any other account than of <hi>what they appear to be:</hi> But as to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>what they really are, as to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Substance,</hi> the Judgment must first consult with what is heard from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> and the <hi>Church;</hi> and hence it may have such information for its coming to an issue, as the other Sences of themselves, could never pretend to. Thus, tho' from the report of the Eyes, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can in <hi>ordinary Cases</hi> with assurance pronounce, which is a <hi>Dove,</hi> or <hi>Young Men;</hi> yet when, by an <hi>extraordinary Power,</hi> God is pleas'd to present under those Forms, other <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Infinite</hi> Beings, as of Angels, or the Holy Ghost; then must the Judgment call in some other help, and not proceed by what <hi>these see,</hi> but by what is <hi>heard</hi> from <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> in this Point; and thus only can we judge aright. And why, but because as in things of <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Artist</hi> gives the most certain account, and it
<pb facs="tcp:154165:9"/> would be a rashness to adhere to the Sences in contradiction to him; so in things that are <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and the <hi>extraordinary Works of God,</hi> 'tis God himself gives the best direction to the Judgment; it must attend to what it <hi>hears from him,</hi> and not what is seen in the Object: And to adhere to the <hi>Eyes, in contradiction to him,</hi> would not be Reason, but Madness.</p>
            <p>Is it not Reason then, that in the Blessed Eucharist, which the Scripture informs us to be the subject of a Miraculous Power, we should not only Enquire what the Eyes See, and Mouth Tastes; but likewise what the Word of God, what Faith and the Church declare in this Case; and rather frame our Judgment from what we thus <hi>Hear,</hi> than from <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Tasting?</hi> And this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any discredit at all to these Sences: For tho' these are to be regarded, about their proper Objects of Colour and Taste; yet when the question is, <hi>What we are to believe?</hi> They must give leave to the Ears to take place, because, as the Apostle says, <hi>Faith comes by Hearing.</hi> Thus we render to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one their due; to God what belongs to God, and to every Sence in their kind, what belongs to them: But to let our <hi>Faith</hi> be directed by what we <hi>See,</hi> rather than by what we <hi>Hear from God,</hi> that we cannot
<pb facs="tcp:154165:10"/> do, because none knows the things of God; but the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Thus having given some light to these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, which are the common Grounds from whence arise all the Doubts or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief concerning this Mystery, I hope on the one side, it may be an Encouragement to Reason and Sence readily to submit to this Divine Truth, and on the other, be a means of raising the Devotion of those, who already believe it; that so with greater fervour of Mind, and admiration of God's wonderful Goodness, they may attend to every part of the great Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood, daily Offer'd for them on our Altars; for the doing of which in particular, I now proceed to the following Instructions.</p>

            <head>Instructions and Devotions FOR Hearing Mass.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>What the Mass is: What the best way of Hearing it.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHich is the best way of hearing Mass?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To accompany the Priest, in Offering with him to Almighty God, the Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ, under the Forms of Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then 'tis necessary every one should know what the Priest does; for, otherwise, how can we accompany him? Pray tell me therefore what tbat is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Without this there's no Hearing Mass with Profit; and therefore, 'tis a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154165:11"/> Point in which every Christian ought to be well Instructed. You are for this end to Imprint well in your Mind, That Priests at the Altar, do the same, which Christ did at his <hi>Last Supper,</hi> and which he Commanded his Apostles, and their Successors, to do after him, when he said to them, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> In obedience to which Command, they do what he then did; that is, They take Bread and Wine to the Altar; they Bless and Consecrate it, by the Power here given them, into his Body and Blood, and offer up this Holy Victim, who is Christ our Lord, to the Eternal Father, in remembrance of his Body and Blood, which were once Offer'd upon the Cross for our Redemption: <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> This it is they do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then I see, the Mass is, as you have already said, an Oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ, under the Forms of Bread and Wine, made in Remembrance of his Death on the Cross. And is not this what you call a Sacrifice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, it is the Sacrifice of the New Law, in which are fulfilled all the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And here you will do well to Observe, That God has always been Worshipped by Sacrifice;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154165:11"/> as you may see in <hi>Abel,</hi> in the beginning of the World; and afterwards in <hi>Moses,</hi> when God himself establish'd the Order of Priests, and prescrib'd the Sacrifices, which were all Types of the Sacrifice, that was to succeed in the Law of Grace. And therefore, as in the Old Law, there were Two sorts of Sacrifices; one, which was Offer'd up <hi>Entire,</hi> and wholly Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the Altar, and was called an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locaust;</hi> the other, Offer'd and Consumed <hi>in part</hi> only; the other part being divided between the Priests and the People, and might therefore be called, <hi>A Communion at Sacrifice:</hi> So here in this one Sacrifice is Christ wholly Offer'd up a Holocaust for Men; and yet so, that both Priest and People partake of the Victim: And thus is the Old Law fulfilled in the New, as to all its Parts and Figures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> I am to remember then, that as in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> were Offer'd upon the Altar, Birds and Beasts, as Turtles, Oxen, Lambs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These Sacrifices were all abolish'd by Christ; and in their place has succeeded, by his Command, the Oblation of Christ himself, the true Lamb of God, that takes away the Sins of the World, and this is the Sacrifice of the New Law. Now I can easily apprehend how the Priests are to make this Oblation,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154165:12"/> because they Bless and Consecrate the Bread and Wine: But how are the People to do it, whose Office is so different from the Priests?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis the Priest alone that <hi>Consecrates,</hi> but 'tis not to be imagined, it is he alone that is to Offer the Victim: No, the Mass is the Sacrifice of the whole Church, that is, both of Priest and People; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Priest Offers it to Almighty God, so ought likewise the People to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, both with the Priest, and by him. For as in respect of the <hi>Consecration,</hi> the Priest is the Minister of Jesus Christ, who has given him power to Consecrate; and who with him Consecrates the Victim; so in regard of the <hi>Oblation</hi> the Priest is Deputed by God for the People, who with him ought to Offer it to God: And this S. <hi>Paul</hi> hints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Every Priest being Chosen from among Men, is appointed for Men in those things that belong to God; that he may Offer Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 'Tis the Priest then alone is to <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate;</hi> but the People are to join with him in <hi>Offering</hi> up to Almighty God the Sacred Host, and desiring him to Accept it. And was not there something of this Method pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the Old Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, the People having brought to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154165:12"/> the Priest what was to be Offer'd, did afterwards in time of Sacrifice, while the Priest was at the Altar, Offer it there to God, by the Hands of the Priest; and on this their own Offering it, as well as on the Priest's, depended the good accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it was to have with God. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this practice you see, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 9, 10. where 'tis related; while <hi>Zacharias</hi> was burning Incense at the Altar, the whole Multitude of the People were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Body of the Temple. Thus in all their Sacrifices, the Office of the Priests was to Offer them at the Altar; while the People Assisting at the Oblation, at the same time Offer'd them to God by the Hand of those his Ministers, either for the Remission of their Sins, for a Thanksgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus in our Christian Sacrifice, ought the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever join with the Priest, in Offering it to Almighty God.</p>
               <p>This Method was earnestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to the Faithful of his time, <hi>Hom. in</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> exhorting them, to bring an earnest Attention with them, to the Celebration of the dreadful Mysteries; and to Consider, that Priests and People make up but one Body; that therefore they ought to join with one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154165:13"/> another, and not to cast off all from themselves, and throw it wholly upon the Priests. The same is urg'd by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rodrigues, Par.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 15. where he says; that tho' it be the Priest only that speaks, and with his Hands Offers this Sacrifice; yet all the Faithful Offer it likewise with him: Which being suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I Declare, says he, the best Method of Hearing Mass, is to go on jointly with the Priest, Offering up the Sacrifice, and doing, as much as may be, the very same that he does; making this account with our selves; that we all meet there, not only to Hear Mass, but likewise to Make and Offer up the Sacrifice together with the Priest; for in reality and in truth the thing is so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Well; but does the Church require this of the People?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There's no Precept for it: But 'tis sufficient that this Method is most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Spirit and Intention of the Church, as may be plainly seen in the Liturgy it self; throughout which it is manifest, the Sacrifice there Offered is <hi>Common;</hi> and that the People are to Offer it with the Priest.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Mass, you see the <hi>Public Confession</hi> is made by the People, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154165:13"/> well as the Priest. <hi>The Kyrie Eleisons</hi> are said by both. The <hi>Gloria in Excelsis</hi> is said aloud, and all in the Plural Number, as including the People. Before every Prayer is said, <hi>Oremus,</hi> whereby the Priest calls on the whole Assembly to join with him. The <hi>Epistles, Gospels</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> are said in a loud voice, to shew they belong to all present.</p>
               <p>As to what follows, tho' said in a low voice, 'tis plain the People are concern'd in it. In the <hi>Oblation of the Bread,</hi> the Priest mentions himself and all present. In the <hi>Oblation of the Wine,</hi> he says in the name of all, <hi>We offer to thee, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. He repeats the same in the following Prayer; and after Washing his Fingers, he prays thus, <hi>Receive, O Holy Trinity, this Oblation we make thee,</hi> &amp;c. And then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the People, he says, <hi>Brethren, Pray that my Sacrifice and yours may be Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the sight of God,</hi> &amp;c. And then calls on all to join with him in Thanksgiving, requiring them to <hi>lift up their Hearts, and give Thanks to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Canon</hi> all is exprest in the Plural Number, as in the first Prayer: <hi>We hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech thee to Accept and Bless these Gifts and Sacrifices we Offer thee.</hi> In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: <hi>Be mindful, O God, of thy Servants,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:154165:14"/>
                  <hi>and of all here present, for whom we Offer, or who Offer to thee this Sacrifice.</hi> In the third and fourth the People are included with the Priest.</p>
               <p>And thus still he goes on after the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <hi>Wherefore we thy Servants, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thy holy People, mindful of thy Passion,</hi> &amp;c. and so in all the following Prayers: <hi>We humbly beseech thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And to us Sinners,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deliver us from all evils. Lamb of God, have mercy on us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus considering the whole Liturgy, 'tis evident the Mass is a Sacrifice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to Priest and People; and while we behold the Spirit of Christ, and his Church in the Institution of it, it may be easily concluded, the manner of Assisting at it, which is most conformable to this Spirit, must necessarily be the best.</p>
               <p>On which grounds it follows; that as many of the Faithful, as desire to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to this Spirit of the Church, when they go to Mass, ought to go with the intention of Offering to Almighty God, with the Priest, this great Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently be very careful to accompany him, if not in all, at least in the principal parts; that so by this means, they may more effectually partake of the Fruits of it.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:154165:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> I don't see this is the general Method of the Faithful; for they seem to understand, that the making the Oblation belongs only to the Priest, and their part is only to Assist at it with Devotion, that so they may have some share in its Effects, and in the Prayers there said by the Priest; for this end we see some saying their Beads all the time of Mass, others their Morning Prayers, others the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Day, or some private Devotions, and but with very little regard to what the Priest does; and is not this very far from what you speak of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis different; but yet I question not, but as many as are there with their Souls truly raised to God, partake in some degree of the Effects of this Holy Sacrifice; and therefore, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their Devotions, I only propose a Method, which is judged the best, and may be most for our Spiritual Advantage, such as is generally observed, by as many as perfectly understand their Duty, and would be follow'd by others, were they better instructed. For this end I make it here my request to the generality of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, not to content themselves with some <hi>general Notions</hi> concerning the Mass, but to take pains themselves, and engage some Charitable Friend to give them a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154165:15"/> more particular Instruction, and make them sensible of the true Nature of it, and all its parts, that so they may lose none of those Advantages otherwise to be reaped in this Divine Institution; and that thus may be avoided many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Indecencies and irreligious Levities, too often seen at that Holy Time, and which most certainly arise from a want of due knowledge and instruction of what is there done, and of what is their Duty to do.</p>
               <p>And now as to those, who in time of this Divine Sacrifice, are wholly taken up in saying the <hi>Rosary,</hi> or other <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Devotions;</hi> I only desire them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, they have a great part in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice there Offered, that it belongs to them to Offer it to Almighty God with the Priest, as likewise in some manner to partake of the Victim. That, since their Heavenly Father has call'd them to so great a Dignity, they would spare so much time from their <hi>private Devotions,</hi> as to comply with this greater Duty, than which none can possibly be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God. And therefore, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perswaded to change their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, that they would make such inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions at least in their other Prayers,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154165:15"/> as may give them liberty in some degree to perform this; that is, lay them by at the more Essential Parts of the Mass, to which they ought to give their Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Well, I understand you now, that the Mass is the Oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ made to Almighty God; that the Priest is deputed to consecrate and make this Oblation, and that the People are likewise to offer it with him. But now you must tell me in what manner they are to do this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I'll shew you the best Method I can: But I must first lay before you the <hi>Chief Ends,</hi> for which this Sacrifice is to be offer'd by all Christians.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Of the</hi> Principal Ends, <hi>for which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Body and Blood of Christ is to be offer'd: And of the</hi> General Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions <hi>in the Offerers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE First Duty of a Christian, is, <hi>To render to God that supreme Honour and Worship which is due to Him, as the Soveraign Being.</hi> And this being not possible to be more effectually done, than by offering to him the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his only Son; insomuch as this is an Oblation of infinit Value, being God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154165:16"/> equal to himself; therefore it is, That the <hi>First and Principal End</hi> of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, in going to Mass, ought to be, <hi>To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to God the Supreme Being, and give him that Honour and Worship, which is due to him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another principal Duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, being, <hi>To give thanks to God for all his Blessings:</hi> And there being no more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Offering we can make him, than of his only Son, in whom he is well pleas'd: Therefore it is, every Christian, in going to Mass, ought to remember, that <hi>another Principal End,</hi> is to offer to Almighty God this Sacrifice of his only Son, <hi>in Acknowledgment and Thanksgiving for all Benefits and Blessings receiv'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther General or Particular, Public or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Since in the Mass is offer'd to God the same Body and Blood of Christ, which, being Sacrificed on Mount <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> were a full Satisfaction for Sin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that the daily Oblation of the same on our Altars, renders God Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, by being a daily Application of the Merits of his Son's Passion, and moves him to grant Grace and the Gift of Penance, in order to the Remission of the greatest Sins: And for this End, every Christian going
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154165:16"/> to Mass, ought to lay before the Father, the Merits and Passion of his only Son, who is there offer'd, with a firm Hope of obtaining, thro' him, that Grace, which may be the effectual Remedy of all their Offences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ, being thus a Means of daily laying before the Eternal Father, the infinit Value of his Son's Bitter Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore it is a daily Application of the Merits of Christ to us, likewise for the Relief of our Necessities, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining new Graces and Blessings for us: And for this reason, every Christian in going to Mass, ought to offer it to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God for the obtaining all Blessings, whether Temporal or Spiritual, whether for themselves, Friends, Governors, or Church, and for the Remedy of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series and Necessities, public or private.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Four Principal Ends,</hi> for which all the Faithful ought to offer up the Holy Victim, Christ Jesus, in the Mass, to the Eternal Father; for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory, and their Good, ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring besides, in this Oblation, to renew daily the Memory of Christ's Death and Passion, as he himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:154165:17"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>So then as often as the Faithful go to Mass, they ought to join with the Priest, and offer up the Body and Blood of Christ;</hi> 1. <hi>For the giving</hi> Supreme Worship to God. 2. In Thanksgiving for all Benefits. 3. <hi>For the</hi> obtaining Pardon of their Sins. 4. For the procuring new Graces and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; <hi>and ever in</hi> Remembrance of Christ's Passion. <hi>Is there any thing more on this Subject?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only my Request again to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, so seriously to reflect on these <hi>General Ends,</hi> for which they go to Mass, as to let this be a Means of regulating their Devotion, of raising their Spirits to God, and keeping up that true Christian Behavior and Reverence, as seem absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for those, who desire to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves well of these great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How do you mean in particular?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That while Christians in the Mass offer to Almighty God the Body and Blood of Christ, thus to pay <hi>Soveraign Homage</hi> to him, they would look on Christ on the Altar, as their Model, and there Consecrate themselves daily to God, by making a Sacrifice of their Body and Soul, according to that Pattern before their Eyes; and thus heartily endeavor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154165:17"/> to give Soveraign Honour to God, by offering not only Christ, but themselves likewise to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That as often as they offer Christ in <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to God for all his Benefits, they would likewise join themselves to that Sacrifice, and make an Oblation of their own Hearts to God; remembring the best Acknowledgment on their part, of Blessings received, is a true Christian Life, and the employing all that to his Honour, which has been the Gift of his Goodness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in offering Christ on the Altar as a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for their Offences, they would remember, that Christ there offered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Remedy for Sin, by presenting himself to the Eternal Father, to suffer whatever Punishment his Justice should appoint, for the making due Satisfaction for the Transgressions of Men: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently if they desire to partake of the Effect of this Oblation, in the Pardon of their Sins, they would there present themselves before the Altar, in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Penance.</hi> 1. Humbling themselves at the sight of their Offences; with a contrite Heart; beseeching God to grant them a sincere Repentance. 2. Offering themselves, according to the Example
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154165:18"/> before them, to suffer whatever God's Justice shall determine. And 3dly, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, that as they offend daily, so their Life shall be a <hi>daily and continual Penance,</hi> not doubting, but Christ's Infinit Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, shall be thus effectually applied to them, and supply all their Defects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in offering Christ on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, for the <hi>obtaining new Blessings,</hi> they be careful to put up all their Prayers to God, <hi>in his Name;</hi> depending entirely on Christ as their Redeemer, as their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and as their Head; and putting themselves in such a Disposition of Soul, that they be truly his Members, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to live by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thus if the Faithful present themselves before the Altar, in this manner to offer up that holy Victim, Christ Jesus, to his Eternal Father, it will most certainly be for God's Honour, and the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their own Souls. But if they think nothing of these <hi>interior Dispositions,</hi> but run to Mass out of Custom, without any concern of thus raising up their Thoughts to God, or applying them, as the nature of this Sacrifice requires; being there in a formal way, like so many Statues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out praying or thinking, I can't tell what Benefit they expect, or even what they do
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154165:18"/> there. And then for many others, who in that lazy Posture of kneeling on one Knee, seem to be paying their Duty to some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-God; others who are gaping and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about, others who are prophanely Whispering and Conversing, others in their Vanities, and even in the State of Sin, with more still of this kind; what can I say of them, but that they abuse the Blessings of Heaven, make void the Designs of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and are most irreligiously Dishonouring God in that Divine Institution, which was ordain'd for the giving him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Worship? Can these any ways hope to obtain Pardon of their Sins, thro' that holy Victim, who in the time of its offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are giving new Provocations to Heaven in the addition of their Sins; especially those who think so little of Contrition or Repentance, that knowing themselves to be in a wicked State, resolved to go home as they came? Will God accept this Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them, who has declared, he will receive no Sacrifice from polluted Hands? Certainly, there's little grounds to flatter them with such hopes: They have more reason to fear the part they have, in being present at this holy Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to make it a <hi>full Resemblance of</hi> Christ on the Cross; and therefore, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154165:19"/> when he was nail'd to that Sacred Wood, there wanted not some, who Reproached and Blasphemed him in his Sufferings; so here being now offer'd an unbloody Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim, 'tis not without some, who by their irreligious Behaviour and criminal Lives, like those wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> cast out Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against him: Who are yet so much worse than they, inasmuch as their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Belief is an Aggravation of their Crime, beyond that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had Ignorance to plead for them, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not what they did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then I see, to run to Mass and see it ended, is not sufficient to partake of the Effects of it, unless a Person be careful to assist there with great Attention, Application and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. What then will become of many that think not of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis every one's Duty to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and instructed in such Obligations as belong to their State, as to do them well, and if they are wanting in this, they have so much to answer for. Now a little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is sufficient to make them sensible of these general Dispositions thus required of them: For if they once reflect, that in going to Mass they go to <hi>Honour God,</hi> to <hi>Think him for his Benefits, to beg Pardon for their Sins, to Pray for new Blessings,</hi> and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154165:19"/> to <hi>Commemorate the Death of Christ;</hi> does it not immediately appear, that both a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Behaviour, a Sincere Devotion, and Hearty Repentance,</hi> is necessary for the due performing these Obligations; and that without this, they are not truly qualified for the just discharge of these great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>I see the reason of what you say, and wish all duly considered it, for their own good. But having now understood the Principal Ends and General Dispositions, with which we are to hear Mass, you must now comply with your Promise, and lay before me an easie Method for the joining with the Priest in making this Oblation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That I'll do; but you must give me leave to speak to more than yourself: For there being amongst the Faithful, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of very different Capacities, some that understand little, others that are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed; there is no one Method proper for all; and for this reason, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to propose three, answerable to the three different Degrees or Orders, in which all the Faithful may be ranked. One for young Beginners, who being wholly Strangers to this Public Service of the Church, desire to be instructed in it: Another for the generality of Catholics,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154165:20"/> who by Education or Practice are better acquainted with it. A third for such, whose Learning, Piety or Parts, raise them something above the rest. And a fourth may not be improper, for such as are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;</hi> and thus I shall include the whole Body of the Faithful.</p>

               <head>First Method of Hearing Mass, for young Beginners.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> WHat Directions do you give to such who as yet knowing nothing of the Mass, desire to be instructed in it? What would you have them do at first, when they are present at it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> My Advice is, that at first when they go to Mass, they would for the first eight or ten Days, use no Book at all; but bend their whole Endeavours, to observe what the Priest does, by only looking on. By this means, in a Week or Fortnight, (it being every Day the same) they'll begin to observe the more remarkable parts of it: As, 1. The removing of the Book. 2. The uncovering the Chalice. 3. The putting Wine into the Chalice. 4. The lifting up the Host and Chalice. 5. The Priest Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 6. His giving the Benediction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having observed something of this, it will be then a great help, to have some
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154165:20"/> Charitable Friend kneel by, and inform them how these parts are called, or what is then done; but so, as not to burthen them with too much at first. They may let them know, when the Priest says the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> or publick Confession. That at the first removal of the Book, is read the <hi>Gospel.</hi> At the uncovering the Chalice, or putting Wine into it, is the <hi>Offertory.</hi> At the lifting up the Sacred Host and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, is the <hi>Elevation.</hi> When the Priest Receives, is the <hi>Communion,</hi> &amp;c. By this means, being thus acquainted with what is thus done, and the <hi>Names,</hi> by which these parts are called, they'll be soon fit to use Books of Devotion, and say the Prayers proper, as in them directed by their Titles over them; and by these be prepared to understand all the rest.</p>
               <p>Being come thus far, it may be proper here again to inform them, as before; That the Priest at Mass, Consecrates the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ; then Offers this Holy Oblation to God, for his Honour and Glory, for the good of his own Soul, and of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. That the Priest knowing how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy he is to perform this Solemn Action, dares not approach the Altar, till by saying the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> he has first
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154165:21"/> humbled himself in the Confession of his Sins before God: And that since the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to join with the Priest in Offering to God the Body and Blood of his only Son, 'tis but reasonable, they should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise humble themselves, with the Priest, in the Confession of their Sins, by saying the <hi>Confiteor</hi> with him, or some other Prayer answerable to it, in the true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Humility and Contrition.</p>

                                 <p>If thou yet receivest me, as a Prodigal Son, Grant, Lord, that my Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may something Correspond with that High Birth, where Flesh and Blood are not concerned; where my Will may desire nothing, but as directed by thine.</p>
                                 <p>Thou God Incarnate, have Pity on my Frail and Mortal Flesh, and Grant it may one Day see, what it here Adores below. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <q>IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. This was in the beginning with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154165:56"/> God. All things were made by him, and without him was made nothing, that was made. In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men: And the Light shined in Darkness, and the Darkness did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. There was a Man sent from God, whose Name was <hi>John.</hi> He came for a Witness, to give Testimony of the Light, that thro' him all might believe. He was not the Light, but was to give Testimony of the Light. He was the true Light, that Enlightens every Man, that comes into this World. He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not. He came to his own, and his own received him not. But as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, he gave them Power to be made the Sons of God, to those, who believe in his Name; who not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God, are Born. <hi>And the Word was made Flesh,</hi> and dwelt in us; and we saw his Glory, as the Glory of the only Begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of Grace and Truth.</q>

                     <p>Thanks be to God.</p>

                  <p>IN this Method of Hearing Mass, it may be easily observed, how exactly the Faithful Accompany the Priest, almost in all he says; it being generally the same, as to the substance, only accommodated to them, in consideration of the part they bear, in the Solemn Act of Worship.</p>
                  <p>And now, while the Church seems to require the Faithful, to join with the Priest; may not they, who follow this Method, satisfie themselves, that they have complied with their Obligation; and likewise hope to obtain large Blessings from the Hand of God, who have wholly applied their Thoughts to this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and permitted nothing to divert them from it? And tho' others chuse at this time, to satisfie themselves with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions; is it not to be feared, that a want of due understanding of the Mass, is too often the occasion of it? Let them Reflect at least, whether the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude of Finishing the Task of those Prayers, they propose to themselves, does not often take off their Thoughts and Devotion from such principal parts of the Mass, to which they ought most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to attend. How often do they quite pass over the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Offertory,</hi> the <hi>Memento</hi>'s, the <hi>Communion,</hi> &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154165:57"/> any sort of Application? And if they lay by their Books at the <hi>Elevation,</hi> they snatch them up again with so much haste, that 'tis plain, they allow not themselves that time, as is suitable to the greatness of the Mystery, or as may be most Beneficial to their own Souls: What I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to recommend to these, is to Reflect on this matter a little, and consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be reasonable, to make the <hi>Greater Act of Religion</hi> give way to the <hi>Lesser;</hi> and since the Hearing Mass, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod here proposed, includes in an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner all other Private Devotions, whether it be not most just, to allow to the Mass, the Time, that belongs to it; and not borrow from that, for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying other Duties: This I say to such as truly understand it: For as to others, who have only a very Gross and Imperfect Knowledge of it, 'tis not to be wonder'd, if they take another way, and make use of a Staff, who are so weak, as not to be able to go without it. But then let these too consider, how far they are bound to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for their Improvement, and not be at a stand in a matter, which being so much to their Souls Disadvantage, must necessarily be Censured as a State of Sloth and Neglect. But now leaving these, I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154165:58"/> turn to such, as are advanced in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, and know how to Speak to God, without the Immediate Help of Books; having some Directions to lay before them; which likewise may not be improper for others to read, who are not yet come to this degree.</p>
                  <p>But First, I think it may not be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper here, to give a short Glance at the Chief Ceremonies used at Mass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those, who understand enough to follow this Second Method, may make some Reflection on them, such as may be a great help to direct them in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>First then, <hi>Bowing down</hi> is a posture often used by the Priest in time of Mass; <hi>viz.</hi> as often as he says such Prayers, in which he <hi>acknowledges his unworthiness, Humbly makes his Offering to Almighty God, begs for Mercy, &amp;c.</hi> and this he is ordered to do, that by this External Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, he may be put in Mind of that Interior Humility of Spirit, with which he ought ever to perform those Actions; as likewise to direct all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent then to Humble themselves before Almighty God, while they see the Priest thus bowing down.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:154165:58"/>
                  <p n="2"> 2. <hi>Kneeling,</hi> is generally in the Mass an Act of Adoration, by which the Priest gives Soveraign Worship to Christ our Redeemer really present in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist: And therefore this the Priest performs with all the Powers of his Soul, Adoring before his Lord, and shews the Faithful, how they ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Adore in Spirit, as often as they see the Priest kneeling before the Holy Eucharist. He kneels likewise once in the middle of the Creed, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces these Words; <hi>Et Homo factus est; And he was made Man.</hi> And once at the End of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, when he says; <hi>Et Verbum Caro factum est; And the Word was made Flesh.</hi> Both times to signifie the Second Person of the B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity coming down from Heaven, to take on him our Nature, so to become our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: In Acknowledgment of which Mystery, all Christians ought to bow, both Priest and People, so to testifie their Sense of that Infinite Mercy, and give Thanks for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Striking the Breast,</hi> is a Ceremony delivered in Scripture as an Expression of a Sincere Repentance, in the Poor <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can:</hi> And this the Priest uses, as often as he professes a Repentance for his Sins;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154165:59"/> as in the <hi>Confiteor:</hi> Or begs for Mercy; as at <hi>Agneus Dei:</hi> Or confesses his Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness; as at <hi>Domine non sum dignus.</hi> And if he does this, not as using a bare Ceremony, but with a truly Humble and Contrite Heart, there's no question, 'tis what is very Christian; and may serve likewise to move the Faithful to a Hearty Contrition, and Sincere Acknowledgment of their unworthiness, as often as they Practice the like Action. And if they would thus seriously return to the Heart as often as they strike their Breasts, they might reasonably Hope with the <hi>Publican</hi> to go home justified.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Turning to the People,</hi> is what the Priest does, as often as he gives a Blessing to them, in saying, <hi>Dominus vobiscum; Our Lord be with you,</hi> &amp;c. or desires their Prayers, as at <hi>Orate Fratres; Brethren Pray,</hi> &amp;c. For as when he makes his Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Prayers to God, he stands with his Face to the Altar, which is the Place of Worship: So when he Addresses himself to the People, he turns to them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Making the Sign of the Cross,</hi> is used in Blessing the Bread and Wine, as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our Belief, that all Grace and Benediction, is to come to us
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154165:59"/> thro' the Merits and Passion of Christ Crucified.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Kissing the Altar,</hi> is what the Priest does, before he Blesses the Offering, or the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to signifie again, that all Peace and Blessing is purchased for us by Christ Suffering on the Cross, which is represented by the Altar: And that all good is to come to us from him alone. Thus far of some General Ceremonies. The several Parts of the Mass may be likewise here very well observed. The First Part, is from the beginning, till the Priest unveils the Chalice: And this is a preparation of Priest and People for the great Action of the Sacrifice; and consisting of Humiliations, in Confessing of Sins, Begging for Mercy; of Prayers, and Reading part of the Holy Scripture in the Lesson and Gospel; and of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith in the Creed. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part is from the unveiling the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, till 'tis again covered with the Veil. And in this is performed the Sacrifice; the Bread and Wine being first prepared at the <hi>Offertory,</hi> then Blessed and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated into the Body and Blood of the Lamb; and then Consummated at the <hi>Communion.</hi> The Third Part, is from the Communion, or Second veiling of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154165:60"/> Chalice, to the End, and this is a Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. This being observed, we turn now to the Persons already mentioned.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="method_of_hearing_mass">
               <head>Third Method of Hearing Mass, proper for such as are more advanced in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Way.</head>
               <p>TO those, who know how to Govern their Thoughts, and are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the way of the Spirit, the Hearing Mass is but one continued Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Soul, in all the Acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Virtues: When applying her self to every particular Part, she is led from one Virtue to another, with great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sweetness, but without Disorder. This is done by an inward Light Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by Almighty God, not only to Men of Learning; but oftentimes to such, who, being otherwise Weak and Ignorant, have nothing but Humility, and seeking God with Sincere Hearts, to prepare them for these Favours of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>All these, when they go to Hear Mass, go as to a School of Virtue, where they are to meet their Divine Master, by whom they are to be instructed in all the Rules of a Christian Life, to be reproached of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154165:60"/> all their Failings, and encouraged in all those great Duties, which are required of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They behold in this Mystery, Christ our Lord in the Flames of Divine Love, Offering himself a Sacrifice every Day to the Glory of his Father. Which is a Lesson to them, that if they design truly to belong to God, they ought daily so to offer themselves to him, that their Lives become a perpetual Sacrifice; and that they endeavor to live no more to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They see an Excess of that other Branch of Charity, which regards our Neighbour in the Holy Eucharist, where Christ gives himself to the Faithful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Form of Bread and Nourishment, by means of which, they may be wholly Changed and Transformed into him. And this is a Rule to them, of the Love they ought to bear their Neighbour; and a Reproach, as often as they consider, how Interest and Self-love makes them Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this Great Duty, and lay a ground for Misunderstandings, Complaints and Quarrels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They see him there in a State of Humility, under the Sacramental Species: This is to them a Condemnation of all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154165:61"/> Pride, and by his Example, suppressing all vain Esteem they can have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They behold in him a wonderful Patience; bearing not only with the Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of Unbelievers, but also with the Sacriledges of unworthy Receivers. This Confounds their Excessive Niceness, who cannot without Disturbance, bear the least Injury or Contempt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They consider him there in a State of Poverty: This condemns all Thoughts of Covetousness; and encourages them to cast off all Vain Solicitude, and submit to Inconveniences without murmuring.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They see him there, as it were in a State of Penance, covered with those Sensible Accidents, as with Sackcloth and Ashes, and thus Offering himself to his Eternal Father, as an Host of Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our Sins: This shews them how to Repent of their Sins; and with what Charity they ought to Pray for all those, who are separated from God by their Offences, and are under the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Vicious Habits.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They see him there an Advocate for all, even for those who have offended him: This forcibly moves them, to cast off all sorts of Animosities, Ill-will, or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:154165:61"/> Hatred, from their Hearts, and to let no kind of Injuries be a Confinement to their Charity, which ought to be, like their Masters, extended to all.</p>
               <p>Infinite other Lessons of this kind they Hear from their Divine Master in this School of Piety; such as the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand: Whilst placing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at his Feet, like Holy <hi>Magdalen,</hi> with Humility they say to him in their Hearts, <hi>I will hear what our Lord shall speak:</hi> And there receive as many Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as there were Eminent Virtues practised by our Redeemer. I will here propose some Method of this Interior Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, for the help of such as desire to be acquainted with this way: But first shew you a Form, in which they Offer this H. Sacrifice to God, before the Priest comes to the Altar.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>An Oblation of the Mass, as it gives Supreme Worship to God.</head>
                  <p>HOly Trinity, one God, whose Power, Wisdom; Goodness and Mercy is Incomprehensible, here prostrate in Body and Soul I Adore thee; and present my self now before the Altar, to join with thy Servant in Offering to thee the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154165:62"/> of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the greater Glory of thy Name, in Acknowledgement of thy Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Dominion over all Creatures, and our Intire Dependance on thee: In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of thy Infinite Perfection, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Glory. And with the Sacrifice of Praise, I likewise offer thee all that Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which he gave thee while yet on Earth; as also all that Honor, Praise and Homage which have been Paid thee by the Blessed Virgin, and all the Angels and Saints. For as to my self, what am I, but a Miserable Sinner, a Poor Worm of the Earth, unworthy to appear before thee; and therefore wholly confiding in the Merits of thy Son our Lord I cast my self before thy Throne of Majesty, Confessing to the whole World, that I am the Work of thy Hands, and as nothing before thee. I wish, that as many as thou hast Created in all Nations, were now adoring on their Knees before thee, and giving Sovereign Honor to thy Name! But because there are Infinte Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that know thee not, and of those that know thee, too many that Adore thee not; therefore, for all these, I now Adore thee; and humbly beseech thee, to accept this Oblationa, in supply and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154165:62"/> satisfaction for all their Sins and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, by which they Offend against thy Laws. To thee, O God, be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Glory, thro' Christ our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Accept it likewise in Thanksgiving for all that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Graces pour'd forth on the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, and on all thy chosen Servants, especially those, whose Memory and Virtues we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154165:63"/> Honor this Day. Let it be a Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for all those Gifts, by which thou raisest so many, while yet on Earth, to an Eminent Degree of Holiness; for thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Patience in bearing with Sinners, and granting them time to Repent: For all thy Favours bestowed on all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether Friends or Enemies, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or Unbelievers: For thy Protection and Assistance given to thy Church: For that Love, by which thou hast made me a Member of it: For thy wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in delivering me from so many Dangers both of Soul and Body; for Strengthning me in Temptations, Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in Difficulties, Comforting me in Afflictions! For all thy Light and Grace, by which thou hast Conducted me in the Way of thy Commandments, and givest me hope of persevering to the end: For all Temporal Blessings, by which thou hast Encourag'd me; for all thy Scourges, by which thou hast Instructed and Corrected me. For these and infinite other thy Mercies, I now desire to return thee the poor Tribute of a grateful Mind: But what kind of return can I make, who am nothing but Misery, Sin and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? I will therefore now offer thee the Sacrifice of thy only Son: His Merits are
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154165:63"/> infinite, and in them only can I find a just proportion with thy Blessings, the Effects of thy Goodness: Accept then this, O Lord, from the Hands of thy Servant; but to all thy other Favors, add now this one of thy Grace, whereby my Heart may go along with the Offering.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154165:64"/> Lord Jesus Christ: Therefore I now come to Offer him to thee a Sin-offering, that laying before thee his infinite Merits, I may obtain of thee, a sincere Contrition of Heart, for the Pardon of all my Sins, thro' his bitter Passion and Death, who being once Offer'd a Sacrifice on the Cross, I now Offer again on thy Altar. For 'tis in him I behold, as it were, a great and spacious Sea of Merits, sufficient, not only to Cover, but even Swallow up all my Offences; 'tis in him I see an infinite Treasure of Satisfactions, for the Release of all my Crimes. Be not therefore angry with thy Servant, tho' in himself most Unworthy, but hear the voice of thy Son's Blood crying out to thee, not Revenge, but Mercy and Pardon.

Grant to our Chief Bishop, to all Prelates and Pastors, that they may faithfully watch over, and feed the Flocks committed to them, both by Word and Example, being ever mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Charge they have undertaken, and performing it without reproof.

Then, in Receiving the Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they open their Hearts, with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a Confidence in God, that he will please to fill them with abundance of Heavenly Graces. Then begging Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for all Distractions and Negligences in time of their Devotion, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themselves to the Divine Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Offering all the Actions of the Day to his Honor; and when the Priest is gone into the Sacristy, if their Devotion keeps them no longer, they then depart with Reverence.</p>
                  <p>Here I have given just a taste of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Sweetness, those Experience, who follow this more Spiritual way, in which there is not one Christian Virtue, but what becomes the Exercise and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul, before the end of Mass, and tho' this be not a Method to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all, because it requires a true understanding of every part of the Mass, and besides this, a great Composure and Command of Thoughts; yet it may be proper for most to read over and peruse; that so they may know how to Embrace and Pursue those good Thoughts to their own Advantage, which occasionally may be Suggested to them in time of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154165:72"/> Offering. For since there are but few so very dull, but they know how to <hi>Think seriously</hi> in a subject of their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interest; methinks 'tis very reasonable, they should learn how to think, when they have God's Mercies, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of their Salvation before them. But in this, every one as well as they can. Now I must turn a little to such, whose Circumstances will not permit them to be present at Mass, on Days of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation.</p>

               <head>Fourth Method of Hearing Mass; Being Instructions for the Absent.</head>
               <p>'TIS but too common a fault of such as cannot observe the Church-Precept, in going to Mass, to sit down at home contented, and think no more of it; as if they had no Concern, or could be no ways Advantag'd by it, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not personally be there. For the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which Mistakes, so prejudicial to them, I desire them to consider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That where ever Mass is said, it is most certainly Offer'd by the Priest and the Church, <hi>for all Faithful Christians, that it may avail them to Life Everlasting,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That since the Mass is Offer'd for those of the Faithful that are <hi>Absent;</hi> these also may receive Advantage by it, if they take Care to dispose themselves, by joining their Devotion with it, and being there in Spirit and Desire, when their Occasions will not permit them to be otherwise present. Since 'tis most certain, God will accept this great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which, in their Hearts they make to him, and their fervent Piety supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all want of Corporal Presence, they'l be refresh'd with Divine Graces, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thro' the Merits of Christ applied by this Sacrifice, which are not confin'd to place.</p>
               <p>From these Considerations, every good Christian, that is Solicitous for his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare, will be Careful on such Days of Obligation, on which he is Lawfully hindred from going to Mass, to take half an Hour to himself, and in his Closet, hear Mass in Spirit; and, if
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154165:73"/> he has a Family, he will not fail to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them together, for the performing this Devotion in Common; first seeing they be instructed how to do it.</p>
               <p>And the first thing they ought to do, is to bewail their Misfortune, in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present at this Holy Sacrifice, by which they are depriv'd of many Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Advantages to their Souls. And if Christians did but a little Consider the many Mournful Expressions of <hi>David</hi> in his Banishment, of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, lamenting their Absence from the Tabernacle and Temple, and the want of Sacrifice, I think they would not sit down so unconcern'd, as too commonly they do, in their Absence from this Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sacrifice, which being so much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than what the <hi>Jews</hi> had, is so much more Considerable in the Losses those suffer who are Banish'd from it. How then might they Sigh with <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 83.</p>
               <p>How lovely are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts! My Soul has a desire and longing to Enter into the House of our Lord.</p>
               <p>My Heart and my Flesh rejoice in the Living God.</p>
               <p>The Sparrow has found her abode, and the Turtle a Nest for her young.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:154165:73"/>
               <p>Thy Altars, O Lord of Hosts, <hi>is the place of my rest,</hi> my King, and my God.</p>
               <p>Blessed are they, that dwell in thy House, O Lord; they shall praise thee for ever.</p>
               <p>Look on us, O God our Protector, and have regard to the Face of thy Christ.</p>
               <p>For One Day in thy House, is better than a Thousand <hi>here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis better to be the least in the House of my God, than to dwell in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Sinners.</p>
               <p>As the Hart Pants after the Fountains of Water; so my Soul sighs after thee, my God.</p>
               <p>My Soul Thirsts after the God of Strength and Life: when shall I come and appear in the presence of my God?</p>
               <p>I have wept Day and Night; because they daily insult over me, and say, where is thy God?</p>
               <p>This came to my Mind, and I pour'd forth my Soul in Grief; because I desire to go to thy wonderful Tabernacle, even to the House of God.</p>
               <p>Hope then in thy God, for I will still sing Praises to him; for he is my Saviour and my God.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:154165:74"/>
               <p>Having thus bewail'd their Misfortune, in not being present at this Holy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and fervently express'd their Desires of being there; every one ought in Spirit to place themselves there, where they commonly hear Mass: And having in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral begg'd of Almighty God, to Accept of that Holy Oblation, which is there Offer'd to his Name, and that they may partake of it; they then apply themselves to the same Devotions they commonly use in time of Hearing Mass.</p>
               <p>And as for those, who are so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, as to know every part of the Mass, and commonly hear it without the help of Books, they may begin and go on from one part of it to another, with all those Exercises, as set down above in the <hi>Third Method,</hi> and, no question, will thus perform a Devotion very acceptable to God, and beneficial to themselves. And for others, who make use of Books in time of Mass, they may use the same Prayers here, according to the <hi>Second Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> or such like; being careful never to omit the Principal Parts of it. For however the Priest be not really with them, yet they are in Spirit, present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar with him; they are before Almighty God, and where the Merits of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154165:74"/> Christ's Sacred Passion may be Applied to them: And will not he most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear them, if with the Prayer at the <hi>Confiteor</hi> they humbly acknowledge their Offences: If at the <hi>Kyrie eleison,</hi> they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily cry out for Mercy: If at the <hi>Gloria in Excelsis,</hi> they give Adoration and Glory to God: If at the <hi>Collects,</hi> they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their own and the Church's Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities: If at the <hi>Gospel,</hi> they make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of living according to the Maxims of God's Word; and so proportionally on with all the other parts of the Mass, as the <hi>Creed, Offertory, Sanctus, Memento's, Elevation?</hi> &amp;c. Will not this be a very Commendable Devotion on any Day, especially those, which are Commanded to be kept Holy; since by this Method, the Soul is awaken'd, and raised up to God, and united to him in the Exercise of those Virtues, which make up a True Christian Life, and render it as much as may be, like the State of the Blessed?</p>
               <p>And tho' this Method may not please some, who are willing to suspect every thing, that seems to streighten the Broad Way they are in, and to oblige them to retrench some of those Liberties, which are the Effects of their Sloth and Indevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet consider'd by Pious and Well-meaning
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154165:75"/> People, I believe, they'll find it very suitable to the Spirit and Practice of the Church in other Duties: For is it not thus in <hi>Fasting, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Alms?</hi> When a Christian, thro' <hi>Sickness,</hi> &amp;c. is disabled from the performing these Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Works; must he not perform them at least, in <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Desire?</hi> Is it not thus with <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Confession</hi> too? So that when a Priest cannot be had, and the Precept urges, must not the Penitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess in <hi>Desire</hi> at least? Must he not Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himself, and call to mind his Sins? Must he not excite in himself a true Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Contrition, and thus, on his part, do almost every thing, as if the Priest were there? This ought certainly to be done at the Hour of Death; and at other times too, it would be the most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured Means of obtaining God's Grace, by thus giving Testimony, that Nothing is wanting on his side, for the discharging that Duty God has laid on him.</p>
               <p>And the ground of this is declar'd by S. <hi>Peter Damian,</hi> who shewing that this Oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ, is the Sacrifice of all the Faithful, who make but One Body; inferrs this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that therefore, tho' we are Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the Church, when these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154165:75"/> Mysteries are Celebrated, yet we still assist there, and in some manner are there Present, by reason of that Inviolable U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by which it is affected, that what belongs to all, is the Concern of every one in particular; and what seems to belong to some in particular, is Common to all, by Means of that Bond of Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which unites all. l. <hi>Dom. Vob.</hi> c. 10. Now, tho' this ought to be no Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any to make it indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go to Church or no, or to omit that Duty, which is so strictly enjoin'd by a Church Precept, and is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with many Advantages and Blessings; yet, when any are lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindred from Personally attending, this ought to mind them, that they may still partake of the Effects of that Holy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and therefore, that 'tis their Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to dispose themselves in the best manner they can, that so they may not be unworthy of those Blessings intended for them; and as they are united to the rest of the Faithful by Faith and Charity, so at that time, they may be more particularly united to them by Prayer and Devotion.</p>
               <p>Among these several ways may all the Faithful, of what Capacity soever, find
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154165:76"/> one proper for them, for the Hearing Mass with Devotion and Benefit. And 'twere to be wish'd, that every one would seriously consult this Matter, both with themselves, and their Director, as to come to a good Understanding of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and see what Method would be most beneficial to them; and not to rest satisfied, till they know how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Priest thro' every part of the Mass, and apprehend the true meaning of the Whole. This, I am confident, would be a Remedy against many Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies; and the great Irreverence too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten met with in Publick Assemblies, where many come, punctually indeed, and with a Design of complying with a Duty, but profit very little, thro' their affected Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and give ill Example and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to others, thro' their Lightness, and too remarkable Indevotion; which is never to be remov'd, till every one take more Care and Pains in being better inform'd of their Duty. Which I pray God, by his effectual Grace, to inspire all to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and do.</p>
               <p>Here, for the sake of such as desire more exactly to accompany the Priest, and observe the Devotion of every Day, I'll set down some Prayers, which may
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154165:76"/> be easily applied to every particular Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and be said in their proper Places, for such as use the <hi>Second Method.</hi> One is for the <hi>Collect,</hi> to be said in its due Place, just before the Epistle: The Second is the Prayer, called <hi>Secreta,</hi> just after <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Fratres:</hi> The Third is the <hi>Postcommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> after the Priest has received.</p>

                  <hi>A Word how the</hi> Sunday <hi>ought to be kept.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> HAving now been so Charitable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, in what manner I ought to hear Mass; pray tell me, whether <hi>in Hearing Mass,</hi> I have discharg'd the whole Duty of the <hi>Sunday?</hi> Or whether when Mass is done, I have still any farther Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on me, relating to that Day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I could wish every one would take Care to hear Mass well and devoutly on <hi>Sundays:</hi> But when that is done, 'tis most certain, the Duty of the Day is not then over; but there is still a due Regard to be had to the Institution of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> The Church Precept enjoins nothing but <hi>Hearing Mass</hi> on <hi>Sundays;</hi> and seems to leave the rest to every one's Disposal?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But can you imagine, the Church Precept makes void the <hi>Commandment</hi> of God? The Church indeed, by her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, declares to all her Members, that she requires them <hi>to hear Mass on</hi> Sundays, but she no where tells them, This is the <hi>whole Duty of the Day,</hi> or pretends to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve them from the Obligation God had laid on them in the <hi>Commandments</hi> given to <hi>Moses.</hi> This Command of God; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou keep Holy the Sabbath Day</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:154165:82"/> only for the Change of the Day) stands still in force; and, as God gave it by <hi>Moses</hi> to his People, so he still gives it to the Faithful by his Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you see it stands Recorded every where amongst the Commandments, in all her Books of Instruction, Prayer-Books and Catechisms; and in all Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Conscience, preparatory for Confession, 'tis in particular call'd over, in several Points, besides what belongs to Hearing Mass; and while the Church thus requires of all, to learn the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> and besides these, to know <hi>her Precepts,</hi> she plainly declares her Sense, that no Precept of hers is intended to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul any Commandment of God; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lets them know, that as the <hi>Publick Worship</hi> of the <hi>New Law</hi> is distinct from that of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> so she requires of all her Members, to be present at this <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> on all <hi>Sundays,</hi> &amp;c. but no where tells them, they have no other Obligation on those Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is it more they have to do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Command of God says, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, thou keep Holy the Sabbath Day:</hi> Every Christian then has all that to do, which is necessary for the <hi>Sanctifying</hi> or Keeping that Day <hi>Holy.</hi> Now can you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:154165:82"/> imagine, the employing <hi>half an Hour in Hearing Mass,</hi> is a <hi>Sanctifying the whole Day?</hi> That is one thing indeed requir'd; but when that is done, a Christian may so easily mis-spend the rest of the time, that casting up his Accompts at Night, he may find, it has been rather <hi>Prophan'd</hi> than <hi>Sanctified;</hi> that he has rather kept it <hi>Wickedly,</hi> than <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides Hearing Mass then, 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Faithful should assist at all the Publick Service and Exercises of the Church: And where Circumstances per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing more than Mass, that this Misfortune be not turn'd to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Idleness and Sloth; but that a proportion'd time be allow'd to private Devotions, and spent in Praying and Reading. This seems to be a Duty: And besides this, it were to be wish'd, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would be so careful in the well-employing this Day, not only in abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Servile Work, and all Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Diversions, but likewise in duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the great Concern of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that upon viewing the main Body of their Actions, they may hope, they have not only Sanctifi'd the Day, but likewise been Sanctifi'd by it.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:154165:83"/>
               <p>To this the Church encourages all her Children, and for this end, in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism <hi>ad Parochos,</hi> set forth by Order of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Charge is given to all Parish-Priests: 1. To take great Pains in often explicating and pressing this Commandment to the People, and gives this Reason; <hi>Because the Observance of all the rest of the Laws of God, depends much on the due keeping of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There it shews, that the <hi>Sunday</hi> is a Day Consecrated to Religious Duties, to Divine Actions, and Holy Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: 'Tis a Day Consecrated to God himself, and therefore to be employed principally in such Actions, as become the Holiness of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It requires Parish-Priests diligently to instruct the People, what are the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proper for that Day. Amongst which, Hearing Mass is in the first place. 2. Often frequenting the Sacraments, for the remedying the Distempers of their Souls; such are, Confession and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 3. Hearing Sermons or Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where it may be. 4. Exercising themselves often on that Day in Prayers, in giving Thanks and Praise to God. 5. Taking great Care diligently to learn all those things, which are necessary for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:154165:83"/> a true Christian Life. 6. Doing Acts of Charity; as relieving the Poor, visiting the Sick, comforting the Afflicted. These Particulars are set down in this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, as Exercises proper for the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying this Day.</p>
               <p>Every good Christian then, may hence evidently discover, that the Design of God and his Church, in commanding this Day to be kept Holy, is, 1. That in it he should give Adoration, Praise, Honor, and due Thanks to God. 2. Do such things as may be for the Advantage of his Soul, either in the Obtaining Pardon of his Sins, Improvement in Virtue, or Benefit of his Neighbor. That for the discharging the <hi>former part</hi> of this Duty, 'tis required of him, he should hear Mass devoutly, and in this pay Sovereign Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to God: That at other times of the Day, he should Pray, give Praise and Honor to his Maker. And for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Second;</hi> That he should go to the Sacraments, Hear Exhortations, Read such Books, as may be proper for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in the Knowledge of his Duty, Amendment of his Failings, Encrease of Piety, and living the Life of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, answerable to his Condition, and doing such Works of Charity, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall present.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:154165:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What think you then of all those, who content themselves with hearing Mass on <hi>Sundays;</hi> and without any more Praying or Reading, spend all the rest of the Day in Walking, Talking, Dressing, Formal Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> And I ask you, whether these do all that God and the Church require of them on these Days? If they do, I have nothing to say against them; but if they are really wanting in considerable Duties, intended for God's Honor and their Souls Good, then do you tell me, whether they are Innocent?</p>
               <p>Those Pious Exercises, above-mention'd, proper for Sanctifying the <hi>Sunday,</hi> are all set down, in the said Church-Catechism, with this recommendation: <hi>Quibus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani homines exereere se debeant. Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in which Christians ought to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> And tho' hearing Mass be first mention'd, yet the other Duties are very much urg'd: There the <hi>wilful Omission of hearing Sermons,</hi> is censur'd as <hi>a Contempt of Christ's Word:</hi> When it recommends <hi>Praying,</hi> this is mention'd, as what ought to be the frequent Exercise and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Day: <hi>Exercitatio atque Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Fidelium in Precibus Frequens esse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> When it mentions the <hi>Learning such</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:154165:84"/>
                  <hi>things as are necessary for a Christian Life;</hi> this is press'd as a Principal Duty, and 'tis requir'd to be done with the <hi>greatest Care: Praecipua Cura:</hi> And when it proposes <hi>doing Works of Charity,</hi> it presses that these be diligently perform'd: <hi>Sedulo se exerceat:</hi> And declares in the words of St. <hi>James,</hi> 1. That this is the <hi>pure and undefiled way</hi> of Worshipping God: By which you see, in what manner the Church desires this Day should be employ'd.</p>
               <p>Now if a Person only hears Mass on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> and spends all the rest of the Day, as propos'd by you above, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing, Walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> does not he omit many Duties, which the Church, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exposition of this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism) requires of him, for the keeping that Day Holy? And do you think this can be without offence?</p>
               <p>Hence, you see, by the Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in this Catechism, all those are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Command of God, 1. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides hearing Mass, do not apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at other times of the Day (if not lawfully hinder'd) to Praying, Reading, <hi>Doing Good Works, &amp;c.</hi> but are wholly taken up in <hi>going their own Ways,</hi> and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasing themselves, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>walk in these Ways of God and</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:154165:85"/>
                  <hi>his Church.</hi> 2. All Parents, Masters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who permit their Children, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus to omit the Duties of the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly to spend the Day in vain Conversation, Visiting, Running Abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. All those, who have the Charge of Souls, and take no Care to employ this Day in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, Instructing and Reforming these Abuses; but let every one go on, as seems good in their own Eyes, to live and die in Ignorance, and under the Slavery of many ill Habits, for want of giving them their due Instruction, and not obliging them to spend that time upon their Souls, which God requires of them: And for as many of the Flock, as shall perish, and God knows how many perish on this Account, who is it must render an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Souls?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If it be thus with those, who pass all the <hi>Sundays</hi> in <hi>unnecessary Visits, Walking,</hi> &amp;c. what say you of those, who spend a great part of the Day, <hi>in Publick Houses, in Drinking, Gaming,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Do you tell me, whether this be a way of <hi>keeping the Day holy,</hi> as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it to be kept? Are these any of the holy Duties and Exercises mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, proper for a Day Consecrated to God's Worship, and the Good of our
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:154165:85"/> Souls? Compare but Sanctifying, and Drinking, <hi>Worshipping or Seeking God,</hi> and Gaming; and see how they agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: When one reads the Precept, and duly considers the End of it, 'tis not easie reconciling these Actions with the Design of our Heavenly Father, in laying this Command on us: For that which is but a tolerable Employment on any Day of the Week, if it be not enough to prophane it; how can it be proper for a <hi>Sunday,</hi> which ought to be kept holy to our Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If there be no Excess, where is the Harm?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The very going into those Houses, to spend the Time in Drinking, seems a kind of Excess, on Days, that are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Consecrated to God: For they are Houses of Idleness, of Excess and Vice; they are Places Prophan'd by all manner of Wickedness, by Blasphemies, Atheism, the Ruin of Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And can it be well-pleasing to God, to spend a Day Holy to him, in Places thus polluted with the Worship of Devils? A Person, that has any Sense of Piety, and of the Reverence due to his Lord, ought to have a dread, especially on such Days, of approaching to them; the thought
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154165:86"/> of the Wickedness there committed, and and of the War there daily made against Heaven, ought to raise an Abhorrence in his Soul, and make him fly from those Seats of Pestilence, as truly at defiance with the Worship of God.</p>
               <p>And this the greatest number of Men are particularly obliged to consider; for tho' they have no design at all of any kind of Intemperateness, on this Day; yet how few are there, that desire to go into Publick Houses on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> but who, on other Days of the Week, have in those Places offended God in their Excesses, either of Drinking, Idle-talking, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ill Example, or immoderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Money or Time? And this has been their Case; ought not they decline those Houses on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> in a just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of their former Offences: Because this is a Day, in which they ought to call themselves to an Account for all the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the Week, and express their sincere Repentance of them, so to make their Peace with God? For, believe me, the Abhorence of Sins seems not very real, where there's yet a Love of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and Places, where they were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As those <hi>Israelites</hi> did not heartily detest their Idols, who had yet a love to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:154165:86"/> the High Places, where they had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But we'll suppose now, for the sake of others, who seem more Pious, that there has been nothing of all this in their whole Lives; may not such as these, take this liberty, and divert themselves with moderate Drinking, Gaming, Shews, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Even this seems not agreeable to the Intent of this Commandment: For, as the Day is holy, so if there be any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version necessary on it, it ought to be such as is in some manner holy too; such as being Innocent, and least expos'd to all danger of Offending either God or Man, is in some kind suitable to a Day that is Sacred. For as Church-Men, who are Consecrated to the Service of God, when they stand in need of any Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought not to consider only, what in it self is lawful, or what is an allowable Diversion in the Laity; but are in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence bound to look farther, and make choice of what is expedient for them, and agreeable to their State; that so they lessen nothing of the Reputation of their Profession, or give Scandal to any little Ones; but in all things shew what they are, as well in the Relaxation of their Minds, as in the Practice of their Duties:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154165:87"/> So certainly on Days, that are Sacred, 'tis not every thing lawful is expedient; but there may be great Indiscretions, if not Offences, by admitting of such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, as are unsuitable to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the Time.</p>
               <p>And amongst these may be justly reckoned, those above-mentioned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that dangerous Nature, that even sober People have not that true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of themselves in them as they ought, but are too often drawn in, even beyond their design, to exceed either in Time or in Words; hence Disputes arise, and such peevish Debates, that tho' they come not to breach of Charity, yet they are very unbecoming the Sanctity of the Day, give Offence to others; and by this ill Example, encourage Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the like Diversions; who not having the true Government either of their Tongues or their Passions, hence fall by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to most Scandalous Extravagancies, such as they must certainly answer for, who instead of preventing, gave Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to these Vicious Liberties.</p>
               <p>Neither can they truly justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who find none of these Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies either in themselves or others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these Diversions have still a kind of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:154165:87"/> Essential Prophaneness in them, which infects the Mind, takes it so much off from God, and all that is good, that they ought, were it for this Reason only, be banished from Days Sacred to God's Worship, and the improvement of the Soul. And this mark the Catechism of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> has set on them, as being the <hi>Occasions of neglecting the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> and therefore it observes, that this Commandment is usher'd in with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, on design to make Christians mindful, that they are like to meet with many Occasions and ill Examples, which will draw them off from the due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Day, particularly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Games and Shows, and those that follow them; as being the two frequent Occasions of Christians contemning and prophaning the Sabbath, and neglecting the Duty of it. And 'tis not to be doubted, but by these Entertainments, People are diverted, even beyond design, from Praying and Reading; and their Minds instead of being purified some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the World, and rais'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God by holy Exercises, are rendred even more corrupt and worldly than they were before. And what then is become of the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and where are the Effects
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:154165:88"/> of it; which being purposely design'd for the withdrawing the Soul from the World, giving it leave to breathe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Spiritual Air, and be refreshed with the taste of Heavenly Sweetness, is so abus'd, if not by vicious, at least by these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dangerous Entertainments, that it serves to clog the Soul still more, and instead of drawing it nearer to God, sets it at a much greater distance from him by these Diversions, than it was all the Week by working?</p>
               <p>And 'tis on this head, all sorts of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Drinking, Shews, &amp;c.</hi> seem censur'd, as not allowable on <hi>Sundays;</hi> not because they are absolutely sinful or vicious; for when they come to this, they are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on all Days of the Week; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they generally so engage and distract the Mind, that they take it off from God, and hinder it from performing those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Piety, which are the Duty of the Day. And therefore as the <hi>Trent</hi> Catechism observes, as servile Works are not forbid on <hi>Sundays,</hi> because of their own nature they are sinful or unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but because they draw away our Minds from the Worship of God, which is the End of this Precept: <hi>Quoniam men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem nostram a Divino cultu, qui finis Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:154165:88"/>
                  <hi>est, abstrabit.</hi> par. 31. So certainly on this Score, are those Diversions to be rejected; for tho' they were as harmless in themselves as working; yet in as much as they are no less a distraction to the Mind, and a hindrance to the Divine Worship, than any servile Work would be, how can these Diversions be more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable than working? Especially too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expresly inform'd by this Catechism, that tho' servile Work only be expresly forbid by this Precept, yet under this is comprehended <hi>whatever is a hindrance to the Worship of God;</hi> and that, whatever this may be, it is as absolutely to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as working. <hi>Quibus Verbis</hi> (viz. Non Facies omne opus in eo) <hi>ad id primum instituimur, ut quacunque divinum cultum impedire possunt, omnino vitemus. parag.</hi> 31. And since common Experience will not allow this to be denied of these Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nay, since they are in particular here set down, as the too frequent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of withdrawing People from the holy observance of this Day, <hi>parag.</hi> 14. it must be acknowledged, they are not sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the design of this Precept.</p>
               <p>And hence you may perceive the true grounds, why spending a considerable part of the <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Visits, Walking,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:154165:89"/>
                  <hi>Conversing,</hi> &amp;c. is above Censur'd, as a breach of this Precept: Because, however harmless all this may be in it self, yet, inasmuch as these so take up the Time, that they are a hindrance from employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Day, in those holy Exercises, as are enjoin'd, they are so far certainly to be disapprov'd and avoided; as also every thing else that is a like hindrance with them; as reading Plays, Romances, History, and all such Books, as are not for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Soul: Singing, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Musick, Discoursing of Neighbors, Sleeping, Dressing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that whatever it be of their nature, that takes off Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from employing the <hi>Sunday,</hi> so to the Honor of God, and the Benefit of their Souls, as God and his Church require of them, it is all, you see here, by the Rule of this Catechism, forbid in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there no Diversion then to be allow'd on <hi>Sundays?</hi> Nothing to poor Servants who toil all the Week, and have no leisure, but on these Days? Nothing to others of a more liberal Education, who must certainly look on <hi>Sundays,</hi> as Days of Penance; if they are to be thus rigorously observ'd; and nothing to be permitted them of these Diversions?</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:154165:89"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have shewn you, in what manner the Church requires the <hi>Sunday</hi> to be kept by all the Faithful; that it ought to be principally employ'd to his Honor, and the Salvation of their Souls; and if you think there is rigour in this, pray forget not, who it is enjoins it, and who expounds it thus; not any Private Hand, but the Publick Catechism of the Church.</p>
               <p>But now if after this, there be many, whose Circumstances require some sort of Relaxation on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> there's no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion there are Cases in which this must be allow'd; but then it ought to be done with the Conditions of the Apostles, <hi>sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, justly,</hi> and <hi>piously,</hi> not falling into the common Abuses, by making the Release of their Minds the <hi>Business</hi> of the Day: But employing the Day in the Duties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, and only taking such a Portion of Time, as both to God and their Neighbor, may appear to be nothing but a necessary condescendance to Humane Weakness, and a just Relief of their Minds: And this in such a way, as is becoming the Sanctity of the Day, and cannot reasonably give Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Weakest.</p>
               <p>But however, as to this particular, I make some Exceptions against the two sorts of Persons mention'd in your last
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154165:90"/> Question, for whom you seem to plead.</p>
               <p>And first, as to <hi>Servants.</hi> Since God has given to Masters of Families Six Days, wherein Servants are to be employ'd in their Work; and has reserv'd only One, wherein they are to serve him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Eternity: Is it not very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that the Diversion Necessary for the Relief of Servants should be taken out of that <hi>One Day,</hi> Sacred to God and their own Souls, and not rather of the <hi>Six,</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Service of this World? Let Masters and Servants consider, where the Time can be best spared; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preferring every thing before God and their own Souls, be what will at the End turn to the best Account. I am certain, if Masters tie their Servants so strictly to their Work all the Week, that they are necessitated to spend the greatest part of the <hi>Sundays</hi> in Diverting and Breathing themselves, so to prepare for their Work again; such Masters will have something to answer for their Servants Sins, in the breach of the Sabbath. And if Servants that have an easier Life, when the <hi>Sunday</hi> comes, take no Care to employ it as they ought, but spend it in vain Conversation, Visiting and Running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, they will certainly be call'd one Day
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154165:90"/> to an Account, for so many great Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of their Duty.</p>
               <p>The Reason of making this Exception against Servants; as likewise all others, whose Life, like theirs, is a perpetual Toil, will appear more reasonable, if we consider, that 'tis almost impossible to conceive, how they can save their Souls, if they abuse the <hi>Sundays,</hi> and neglect to employ them for this End. For if we look on them all the Week, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a continual Slavery, such as hinders them from Praying and Reading; so that if they begin and end the Day with a short Prayer, 'tis as much as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally they do; and God knows how often, thro' Hurry and Drowsiness, they omit even this too. Then how are their Minds wholly tied to the World, by the unhappy Circumstances of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How great does this grow in their Eyes and Heart, by being their whole Concern? What variety of hurtful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions? And how often happens it, that loose Companions undertake to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them by lewd Songs, idle Discourses, and relating such Passages, which serve only to instruct them in Evil? Thus, if we consider them generally, according to the Method of the Week, their Hearts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154165:91"/> and Souls are so wholly Worldly, if not vicious; so truly Strangers to Goodness and the Business of Salvation, that they are altogether unfit for Dying; and if they should thus enter into Eternity, who would not fear what might be their Lot?</p>
               <p>Now if this be the Condition of their Lives on Week-days, have not they great Reason above others, not to neglect the <hi>Sunday;</hi> but so truly to apply themselves, as far as Circumstances permit, to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exercises of Piety, to Reading and Hearing what is good, that by these Helps they may strengthen themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Daily Temptations, Purifie their Souls from the Filth contracted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves of their Duty, and thus learn by degrees not only to toil for Bread, but to work for Eternity, and be true Servants of their Master in Heaven? And if they omit this, is not their State most miserable! For if they go back all the Week, and make no use of the <hi>Sunday,</hi> to recover their lost Ground, but even then go back too; how shall they ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God?</p>
               <p>The Case of the other Rank of People you mention, is not very unlike this: For tho' their Education and Quality has plac'd them in a higher degree, yet the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154165:91"/> Method of their Lives is generally so disorderly, that I think they are under a necessity of carefully observing the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> and if they do otherwise, I cannot but apprehend their State to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>For consider the Reason you bring in their Behalf, for their being dispenc'd with in the Rigour of this Precept: 'Tis because, otherwise, Sundays <hi>will be to them Days of Penance:</hi> Does not this suppose a great Disorder in their Souls, that Reading good things is uneasie to them; that Praying is troublesome; that Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves of their Christian Duties, is nauseous; that to Converse with God, and Labour for their Salvation, is what does not please? Pray reflect seriously on this their Condition, and tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'tis reasonable, these should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xempted from the Duties of the <hi>Sunday.</hi> You see, they are in an ill way; their Souls are wholly indispos'd, if not sick to Death; and is this a Reason, why they should neglect the Means God has appointed for their Cure? Or is it not rather a Reason, why they should be strictly oblig'd to make use of them? Let those, that are truly their Friends, judge the Case.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:154165:92"/>
               <p>The truth of it is this; God has gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally blest this Rank of People with Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And whilst their Condition exempts them from Working, their indulgent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents take no Care in their Education, to make them in Love with any thing, that may be afterwards an Employment to them: Hence, being grown up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing nothing that may be a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Entertainment of their Time and their Thoughts, their Life becomes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idle, they seek the Company of others like themselves, their only Business is to study their Diversion; and being once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in, the whole Week and their Life is but one Round; from Music to Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from Drinking to the Play, from the Play to other Entertainments: Thus by degrees they grow in Love with these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions and Company, and have no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but in this.</p>
               <p>And what kind of Habit is contracted hence? Is it not plain, their Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholly Carnal, Sensual and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they are led along by their Passions; Self-love is their Director, and nothing pleases, that leads them out of this Track? Hence nothing of a Spiritual Life appears in them; they have no taste of Devotion; and whatever time they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154165:92"/> are forc'd to give their Souls, 'tis what seems tedious and uneasie. Hence, to keep the <hi>Sunday,</hi> as they ought, is a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; because their Worldly and Sensual Habit is so strengthen'd by Custom, that it gives them no Rest, whenever, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at better things, they weakly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take another way. And can you think this their Case is so safe, that they ought to be dispenc'd within their <hi>Sunday</hi> Duties? Believe me, I look on them to be in that Danger, that if they use not Violence to themselves, and on <hi>Sundays</hi> apply not their Minds to those Exercises of Piety prescrib'd, I cann't see, which way they are like to be disengag'd from these Snares, but by this Neglect, will be link'd in faster, till they become truly the Disciples of this World, instead of God. You know what the Apostle says; <hi>Amicitia hujus mundi inimica est Dei. The Friendship of this World is an Enemy to God; whoever therefore will be a Friend of the World, makes himself the Enemy of God,</hi> James 4. 4. Consider, if this be not something of their Case; whether you don't experience in them, that they set their Hearts on the World, and are even impatient at every thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God; and what is this, but to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:154165:93"/> love the one, and be averse to the other! And are these to be here dispenc'd with? What is this, but to encourage them in the Evil they have begun, to bid them go on, till they fall into the Abyss of Vice, past all Recovery? For you must observe, what I have said hitherto, is of such, who are not yet engaged in any thing, that is <hi>Criminal;</hi> but of those, who are willing to think themselves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; as being free, as they imagine, from all Vice, and yet are truly guilty of all the Neglects and Disorders above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; and of the <hi>Omission</hi> of those <hi>great Duties,</hi> which <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> oblige them to perform to <hi>God,</hi> in His Worship, and to their <hi>own Souls,</hi> in taking that Care of them, as is necessary for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And this sort of false and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Innocence, is what, I fear, is too common, especially in the younger Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of both Sexes; who, letting the World gain Possession of their Hearts, preserve themselves, it may be, from what is Scandalous and Criminal, but yet at the same time are guilty of many gross Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, such as make them Strangers to Piety; and if not redress'd, will be the evident Ruin of their Souls.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:154165:93"/>
               <p>Wherefore, for the reforming these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Abuses, I cannot but most earnestly recommend to all Christians, the exact Observance of the <hi>Sunday;</hi> making it my serious Request to them, to employ it in the best Manner they can, in those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Virtue, which are most for God's Honour, and the Benefit of their Souls; thus truly endeavouring to give that Day to God, which he has solemnly challeng'd for his own, and expresly commanded to be <hi>kept Holy</hi> to Him: That so perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duty in Obedience to his Law, they may likewise be sensible of the great Advantages he has design'd for them; since 'tis most certain, as the Catechism of <hi>Trent</hi> observes, the due keeping this Day, is the plain and easie way, that leads to a Holy Life, and the most assur'd Means of obtaining the Love of God, as the Neglect of it, is the Contempt of God and his Law, the Path to Looseness and Irreligion, and the Beginning of all Sin; and how highly provoking it is, may be plainly seen in the Severity of those Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which God has punish'd the Transgressors of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Let none therefore be misled by ill E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample; <hi>noli amulari in Malignantibus.</hi> But having God's Word to direct us,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154165:94"/> His express Law to oblige us, the Church to expound his Law to us; let us look for no other Guides, but follow where these lead us; that so giving to God and our Souls what is their due, we may reap the Fruit of this Justice in a happy Eternity, and escape that as lasting Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which will be the Portion, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of those who break All, but even <hi>One</hi> of his Commandments.</p>
